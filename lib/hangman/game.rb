  	#When the program first loads, add in an option that allows you 
  	#to open one of your saved games, which should jump you exactly 
  	#back to where you were when you saved. Play on!

  	#zaladuj plik dictionary
  	#sprawdz czy gracz chce ustalic haslo, jezeli nie haslo ma zostac 
  	#wylosowane (najpierw stworz paczke wyrazow o dlugosci 5-12 znakow)

  	#Now implement the functionality where, at the start of any turn, 
  	#instead of making a guess the player should also have the option 
  	#to save the game. Remember what you learned about serializing objects... 
  	#you can serialize your game class too!
  	#
  	#Every turn, allow the player to make a guess of a letter. It should 
  	#be case insensitive. Update the display to reflect whether the letter 
  	#was correct or incorrect. If out of guesses, the player should lose.
  	#
  	#display some sort of count so the player knows 
  	#how many more incorrect guesses she has before the game ends
  	#
  	#You should also display which correct letters have already been chosen 
  	#(and their position in the word, e.g. _ r o g r a _ _ i n g) and which 
  	#incorrect letters have already been chosen.
